A web interface for running tweetstorms, if you're not into using [this](https://github.com/sferik/t) all cli style.

Clone/fork this badboy, run "bundle install", followed by "padrino rake ar:migrate" then "padrino start" navigate yourself to localhost:3000 and follow the instructions, above all stay safe, and have fun!

ps: does not support windows (might work with cygwin...but i don't have a windows box), linux/osx works fine
